# WOn-t_hit_Bot
A small robot that avoids obstacle. Cost optimised for everyone to try out. 

So this repo can be used to build a basic robot that avoids obstacles. The robot documented here will primarily be made in 3 versions namely 1,2 and 3. Version one is made using an arduino controller(embedded C). Version two is made using a raspberrypi(python). VErsion 3 is made using the same raspi controller but a ROS architecture will be implemented on it enabling it to be simulated befor testing
