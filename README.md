# WOn-t_hit_Bot
A small robot that avoids obstacle. Cost optimised for everyone to try out. 

So this repo can be used to build a basic robot that avoids obstacles. The robot documented here will primarily be made in 3 versions namely mark I, II, III. Mark I is made using an arduino controller(embedded C). Mark II is made using a raspberrypi(python). Mark III is made using the same raspi controller but a ROS architecture will be implemented on it enabling it to be simulated before testing
